# Rails Ninja Exercise

Time to get some Rails reps in! In this lab, you're going to set up a full CRUD Rails API for dojos, senseis, and students. You'll do this in two parts:

1. You'll build out a `one to many` backend featuring Dojos that `has_many :senseis`
1. You'll add a Student model to this backend so that Dojos `has_many :students, through: :senseis`.

Let's get to it.

## Initial Setup

1. Fork and clone this repo
1. `cd` into the repo
1. `rails new . -MT --skip-active-storage --api --database=postgresql`
1. `rails db:create`

## Models

First, we need to create your first 2 models. Remember, the format is `rails g model <Model_Name> column_name:data_type ...`. 

Our Dojo model will have two columnsâ€“ "name", which we'll leave as the default string, and "motto" which we'll set as "text".

> `rails g model Dojo name motto:text`

Our Sensei model will have "name" and "image_url" as strings, "wise_quote" as text, and it will reference the id of a dojo.

> `rails g model Sensei name image_url wise_quote:text dojo:references`

If you think you've made a mistake, you can always destroy your model. **Make sure that you do all of your necessary changes before migration.

> `rails destroy model <Model_Name>`.

Now, **double check your migration files to make sure you didn't have any typos**. If you did, fix them. Then, run your migration.

> `rails db:migrate`

Finally, go to your `app/models` folder and:
- in `dojo.rb` add `has_many :senseis, dependent: :destroy`
- in `sensei.rb` make sure that `belongs_to :dojo` is there

Great! Now we'll need some data to see if everything is working the way we think.

## Seed Data

To get some data to work with, let's seed the database. Go to your `/db` folder and add the [seed data](./seed.rd) to your `seed.rb` file. **Do not uncomment the Student instances yet, since we haven't created the Student model.** Once done, run your seed file.

> `rails db:seed`

Let's use the console and Active Record to explore our data. In the terminal type `rails c` to open the console, and using Active Record, check the following:

  - `Dojo.all`
  - `Sensei.all`
  - `Dojo.find(1).senseis`
  - `Dojo.find(2).senseis`
  - `Sensei.first.dojo`
  - `Sensei.second.dojo`
  
_Note: Try adding the [Awesome Print](https://github.com/awesome-print/awesome_print) gem if you'd like the data to look nicer in your terminal. You can also using [pry](https://github.com/rweng/pry-rails) for rails._
  
## Routes

So now that your data is in the database ready to go, let's set up some endpoints so it can be accessed. Navigate to your `config/routes.rb` file and add:

```rb
resources :dojos do
  resources :senseis
end
```

Then, confirm your routes in the controller.

> `rails routes`

## Controllers

We now have our endpoints ready for HTTP calls, but we don't have any logic saying what should happen when those endpoints are hit. Let's set up some controllers to handle them.

> `rails g controller Dojos`

Inside the controllers folder, you'll find `dojos_controller.rb`. Inside that, set up your `index`, `show`, `create`, `update`, `destroy`, and your _private_ `dojos_params` methods.

See how far you can get using your memory or referencing an old project.

Here's the `index` method, just to get the ball rolling:

```rb
class DojosController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @dojos = Dojo.all
    render json: @dojos, include: :senseis, status: :ok
  end
  
  def show
  end
  
  def create
  end
  
  def update
  end
  
  def destroy
  end
  
  private
  
  def dojo_params
  end
end
```

Next, run `rails g controller Senseis` and follow the same steps you followed for `dojos_controller.rb`.  the index method again: 

```rb
def index
  @dojo = Dojo.find(params[:dojo_id])
  @senseis = Sensei.where(dojo_id: @dojo.id)
  render json: @senseis, include: :dojo, status: :ok
end
```

## GET SERVED

Make sure everything is saved and launch your rails server with `rails s`. Visit the following:

  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos`
  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/1` 
  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/2`
  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/1/senseis`
  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/2/senseis`
  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/1/senseis/1`
  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/1/senseis/2`
  
If you see the appropriate JSON data at each of these endpoints, congrats, Rails ninja!

# Part 2

We're now going to add a Student model to our database and create a `has_many :through` relationship. Let's get started:

## Add to Models

In your terminal, add the Student model.

> `rails g model Students name age:integer special_attack sensei:references`

Go to your `db/migrations` folder and double check the migration file. If everything looks good, add the model to your database.

> `rails db:migrate`

Now, let's define the relationship between our three tables by addind the following:

- in `app/models/dojo.rb` add `has_many :students, through: :senseis`
- in `app/models/sensei.rb` add `has_many :students, dependent: :destroy`
- in `app/models/student.rb` add `belongs_to :sensei`

## Add to Seed Data

Next, uncomment the Student instances of the seed data and re-seed your database.

> `rails db:seed`

In the terminal, type `rails c` to open the console and check your app's updated database. Using active record, check the following:

  - `Dojo.find(1).students`
  - `Dojo.find(2).students`
  - `Sensei.first.students`
  - `Sensei.second.students`
  - `Dojo.first.senseis.first.students`
  
Awesome! Now lets set up some endpoints so our newly seeded data can be accessed.

## Set up Routes

In config/routes.rb, add `:students` as a nested route within `:senseis`:

```
resources :dojos do
  resources :senseis do 
    resources :students 
  end
end
```

Again, check your routes in the controller with `rails routes`. Take a look at how the nested models are reflected in the URLs.

_Note: deeply nested routes are typically frowned upon. You should definitely **not** nest your routes any deeper than this._

## Add StudentsController

Time to set up some logic for our student model. 

Run `rails g controller Students` to add a `students_controller.rb` file to your `app/controllers` folder. Like before, see if you can use your other controllers to figure out what needs to go here. On your get routes, try to `include:` both `sensei` and `dojo` data when you return the students JSON. You may have to look up the syntax for this. 


## GET SERVED AGAIN

Make sure everything is saved and launch your rails server with `rails s`. Visit the following:

  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/1/senseis/1/students`
  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/1/senseis/2/students`
  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/1/senseis/3/students`
  - `http://localhost:3000/dojos/1/senseis/4/students`
  
Make sure you see the right JSON data at each of these endpoints. Once everything looks good, we just need to take our final step, setting up CORS.

## CORS Correcting

In your Gemfile, un-comment the line `gem 'rack-cors'`. Then, in your terminal, run `bundle install`.

Next, navigate to `config/initializers/cors.rb` and uncomment the entire `Rails.application.config.middleware...end` block. Make sure the origins are set to `"*"` for all.
